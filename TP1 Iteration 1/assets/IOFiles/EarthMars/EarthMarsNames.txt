Earth, The rocket starts here.
Low Earth Orbit, Specified as an orbital period of less than 128 minutes and an eccentricity of less than 0.25. The starting point for interplanetary travel.
Sun, The rocket flies into the sun. It also burns into a crisp.
Geosynchronous Orbit, GEO. High altitude orbit where the rocket's orbit matches the rotation of the Earth.
Geostationary Transfer Orbit, Similar to a geosynchronous orbit. GTO's are used for orbital transfers. This is implied in its name.
Earth-Moon Lagrangian Point, Magical point in space where the gravitational forces of the Earth and the Moon cancel each other out. Also known as the L4L5 Lagrangian Point.
Lunar Orbit, Lunar orbit. Self explanatory.
Earth Escape Velocity, Earth C3 Point. Good luck out there.
Moon, Not made of cheese.
Mars Transfer Point, Represents the midpoint in the voyage between the Earth and Mars.
Mars Escape Velocity, Much like the Earth C3 Point. Except its for Mars.
Deimos Transfer Point, Transfer route to Deimos.
Deimos, Landing on Deimos.
Phobos Transfer Point, Transfer route to Phobos.
Phobos, Landing on Phobos.
Low Mars Orbit, LMO. Good place to put a satellite or start landing procedures.
Mars, Landing on Mars. Millions of years of evolution and 200,000 years of civilization leading to this one moment.
