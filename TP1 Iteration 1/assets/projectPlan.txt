The rocket simulation project allows the user to calculate a rocket's delta-V
using Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation given parameters such as the rocket's mass
and propellant type. The user is then able to choose different destinations in
a node network for said rocket to travel through.

The project is organized into several packages and classes for each individual
component. For instance, the rocketry package contains code detailling the
different parts of the rocket (including its stages) as well as functions for
calculating delta-V while the fx package contains tools for the project's 
graphical interface such as buttons and dropdown menus.

The most complex portions of the project include the graphical elements as well 
as the node network and delta-V calculations. Since all the UI tools are being
coded from scratch, scene and event handling tools must be developed for the 
program to properly react to button presses and other interactions.

The program is being backed up both as multiple copies on a physical computer
drive as well as on the cloud in github. https://github.com/Novrain7/rocket-sim
